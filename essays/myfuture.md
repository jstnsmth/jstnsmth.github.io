## My Past
My fascination with technology began at an early age. At around nine years old I remember receiving my first Nintendo console. I was so captivated by how such a small device could play so many games. This early exposure sparked my interest in technology and its inner workings. As I got older, my interest deepened when I got my first laptop. I was amazed by how much I could do with it, this fuelled my desire to understand how it all worked more. By the age of fourteen, I remember receiving Minecraft for my birthday. This marked a pivotal moment in my journey because not only did this game provide a lot of entertainment but it also ignited my curiosity about computers. By fifteen, I began experimenting with writing simple batch programs, and by sixteen I delved into Python programming which further expanded my coding skills and deepened my understanding of computer operations. This period solidified my passion for software engineering and made me want to pursue a career in this field. From eighth grade, I knew I wanted to become a software engineer and each experience I have gone through has only reinforced that.

## My Present
Currently, I am deeply engaged in my computer science studies where I am taking classes that are expanding my technical skills and knowledge. Additionally, my coursework in software engineering and computer science in general has been both challenging and rewarding. I am currently focusing on data structures and algorithms along with software engineering which I find to be very interesting. These classes are improving my problem-solving abilities and preparing me for software development tasks.

## My Future
I am looking forward to developing a range of skills and experiences that will further improve my proficiency in software engineering. I am aiming to deepen my knowledge of advanced programming languages, algorithms, and software design principles. Additionally, I am interested in gaining hands-on experience with projects that will have a positive effect on the world and contribute to innovative solutions. Iâ€™m also interested in getting internships to further get more experience in the software engineering field. By challenging myself and expanding my knowledge, I hope to make impactful contributions to the field of software engineering.
