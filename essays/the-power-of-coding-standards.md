## Reflecting on Coding Standards
When I was introduced to coding standards I thought it was similar to a rule book that someone would need to read and follow the rules to write clean code that is reusable and easy to read in large companies. However, as I learned about lints my view changed. Coding standards aren’t just stylistic preferences, they play an important role in improving code quality, encouraging collaboration, and even helping to learn programming languages.

## The Value of Coding Standards
Coding standards provide consistency and dictate everything from naming conventions to documentation practices and error handling. When multiple people are working on a project, using a coding standard will ensure that the code remains readable. This consistency is important when joining a new team or maintaining code beyond your career. Coding standards can also be used as an educational tool. New programmers can follow these guidelines to practice correctly writing code. As someone learns a new programming language, observing and using these coding standards can deepen their understanding of language-specific conventions and syntax.

## My Experience with ESLint and VSCode
This was not my first experience using a lint to check my code. In my ICS 212 class, we used a lint to check our C programs. This was my initial introduction to a lint and I found it interesting how it worked. This past week, using ESLint with Visual Studio Code was great. My previous introduction using a lint was through a terminal, but with visual studio code, ESLint runs in real-time and tells me the errors immediately. ESLint has helped me maintain cleaner code and enhanced my coding skills. However, I found the process of fixing ESLint errors somewhat painful. The amount of errors that would pop up before I was done coding got annoying and felt overwhelming. It made me feel like I was doing something wrong, but in reality, I just wasn’t done writing my code so it was giving me unnecessary errors. Some of these errors provided a valuable learning opportunity. For instance, using ESL int’s rules regarding variable declarations and function definitions has made my code more predictable and easier to debug.

## Beyond the Rules
Coding standards aren’t just a list of rules that have to be followed, they represent an uphold in quality in software development. Coding standards encourage people to think about their code in terms of readability and consistency. The use of coding standards like ESLint and other lints, has the potential to increase the standard of code that is produced in any development environment. In conclusion, while coding standards might not seem needed, their importance shouldn’t be underestimated. They are important in high-quality software engineering, better collaboration, learning and understanding, and code quality. My experience with using ESLint and previous lints has solidified this belief, showing that using lints helps with maintainable, clean code is well worth it in the software development world.
