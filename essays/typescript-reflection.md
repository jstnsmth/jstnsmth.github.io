## TypeScript as a newbie
Recently, I’ve learned TypeScript with no prior knowledge and find it to be interesting and different from other programming languages that I have experience with. I’m experienced in coding in Java, C++, C, and Python and the syntax of TypeScript is most similar to Java. This is nice and convenient since it was easy to learn and pick up. Within less than a week I had a good understanding of the TypeScript syntax and could write programs without struggling with syntax issues. Something that I did have some trouble with was learning what exactly the difference was between TypeScript and JavaScript. I understood that TypeScript compiles into JavaScript before running, but I was confused about all the differences between TypeScript and why one might choose one over the other.

## TypeScript as a Software Engineering Language
In terms of thinking of TypeScript from a software engineering perspective, I find that it’s an amazing language. You can do many things with TypeScript that you can’t do with JavaScript such as defining types and TypeScript being more of an object-oriented language. I’ve been finding it much easier to code in TypeScript since I can explain my types and get error lines when I misuse a data type or make a simple mistake. Whereas in JavaScript, it will just assume that you know what you’re doing. Although I don’t have much experience with TypeScript and JavaScript, from what I’ve experienced so far, I’d have to say I would much rather prefer TypeScript over JavaScript and I feel like it’s a no-brainer for others too because TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.

## Learning reflection
I’m currently in ICS 314: Software Engineering I, and in this class we were introduced to athletic software engineering. I’m a big fan of this style of teaching since this whole style of teaching revolves around the students and how much effort they are willing to put in. The main points of athletic software engineering are motivation, developing competency, WODs, and some others. I’m currently training for a marathon and I understand the need for consistency and putting effort into training. I find that this sort of teaching style relates closely since you need to be consistent with putting effort and time into this class. WODs are short for Workout Of the Day and this is a timed coding problem similar to a leetcode problem. We have so far had some practice WODs which I have found useful. On the first practice WOD I was still confused about the whole process since we had to type the code into a website. After the first practice WOD I got the hang of things and got a better understanding of the WODs. I also appreciate that there were WOD screencasts that had a video of the professor working through the problem with their solution. Overall, I enjoy this teaching style a lot. It can be stressful if students don’t manage their time correctly or don't have the motivation to do the work. However, I believe if the student is dedicated and puts the time in, they will get a lot out of this class.
