## The Importance of Smart Questions
As a Computer Science student, I often encounter questions about code or specific topics. Often when I go and search for answers,  I find that StackOverflow and similar websites have already relevant responses. These platforms are invaluable for students that are seeking answers and also engaging with the community. However, I’ve noticed that while some questions are articulated well, others are broad and lack clear objectives. This is where the skill of asking smart questions becomes crucial.In the field of software engineering, the ability to ask smart questions is an important skill that separates proficient engineers from novices. Smart questions aren’t just inquiries, they are a strategic tool for problem-solving, learning and overall advancing in the field. This essay will explore why smart questions are important for software engineers, the difference between smart and not smart questions, examine how responses reflect on the inquiries approach and reflect on the insights gained from this experience.


## The Smart Way
While I was looking through StackOverflow, I found a question that I was also interested in and wondering about: [“var functionName = function() {} vs. function functionName() {}”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/336859/var-functionname-function-vs-function-functionname). This is an example of a smart question because it provides a concise title that clearly indicates the topic of the inquiry. The user not only presents a clear and focused question but also offers a context by explaining how they came across this question and why it's relevant. Also, they included example code to illustrate their point, which helps others understand their question better. By also listing sub-questions, the user also demonstrates a desire to learn more about the differences between the two examples and it overall enhances the quality of the answers received.

## The Not Smart Way
I found a question that was asked over 12 years ago that still hasn’t received a verified answer and I’m confused on what it is asking. The title is: [“Callback when the options menu creation is complete”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9484009/callback-when-the-options-menu-creation-is-complete). This is an example of a not smart question because the title isn’t a clear and concise question. It seems like the user quickly typed this up and didn’t put much thought into it. The main body of question provides little to no context and the user provides no examples or any detailed information regarding his question. This user could’ve potentially received a verified answer if they asked this question the smart way by having a clear and concise title along with having a detailed question along with providing additional context and information that might help other users understand and answer their question.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, if you have a question and are in need of an answer. The best thing you can do is take your time to ask the question in a smart way. This means that you should provide a clear and concise title along with providing context and additional information in the body of your question. Rereading your question in the eyes of someone else might also help to double check that your question makes sense to others reading.
